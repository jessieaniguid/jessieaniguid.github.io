		<p>In this 2D platformer that explores the absence of 
		light, the player must use Lyte's voice to navigate through ancient caverns 
		and restore the world's light. </p>
		<p>This game was made in Unity by me and three other people. I worked on most of the code, 
		while the others created the art and sounds. This was made in six weeks.</p>

		</a>
		<p>In this 2D hunting game set in prehistoric times, the player is tasked with babysitting their friend, who 
		in return promises future help.</p>
		<p>This was the first game I made in Unity. I was responsible for the code, 
		and my friend dealt with the art.</p>
