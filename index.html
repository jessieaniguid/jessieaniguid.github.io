		<p>In this 2D platformer that explores the absence of 
		light, the player must use Lyte's voice to navigate through ancient caverns 
		and restore the world's light. </p>
		<p>This game was made in Unity by me and three other people. I worked on most of the code, 
		while the others created the art and sounds. This was made in six weeks.</p>
